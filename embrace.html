<p>the faint smell of smoke pierces through the air<br>
   you see a flower on the ground, bathed in soft, orange warmth.<br>
   <br>
   even amongst the flames, it remains entirely still, its form unchanging.<br>
   however, you can't help but wonder, does this warmth truly do more good than harm?</p>
<details>
  <summary><b>embrace it</b></summary>
  <p>believing this to be the right fate for the flower, you deCide to embrace it.<br>
  	 the flames slowly engulf you as well, surrounding you in a warm light.<br>
  	 <br>
  	 your hands remain intact, as does the flower, however, as the warmth pierces<br>
  	 through your skin you feel a Searing pain slowly creeping into your senses.<br>
  	 <br>
  	 as you watch the Petals dance amidst the blaze,<br>
	 you can't help but worry these flames may one day engulf it whole.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>put it out</b></summary>
  <p>worried that the flames may eventually scorch the flower, you decide to put it out.<br>
  	 the warm light slowly fades away, leaving behind only a charred, yet beautiful form.<br>
  	 <br>
  	 you watch as the petals fall off one by one, and break into dust.<br>
  	 one of the petals flies towards you, and singes your hand slightly.<br>
  	 <br>
  	 eventually, all that remains is a pile of flickering cinders, however,<br>
  	 you feel as if you will never forget this flower's <a href="index.html">warmth</a>.</p>
